03:10:35,604 --> 03:10:35,614
then let's look at an example of how it works
 

7019
03:10:35,614 --> 03:10:40,384
then let's look at an example of how it works
imagine the site mail.ru and that the hacker

03:10:40,384 --> 03:10:40,394
imagine the site mail.ru and that the hacker
 

7021

03:10:50,594 --> 03:10:55,144
the user visits mail.1 and
